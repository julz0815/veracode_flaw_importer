# veracode_flaw_importer 
Import Veracode static analysis findings to Github Security "Code Scanning Alerts"

# Required paramters
### `app_name`
**Required:** The name of the application
### OR
### `app_guid`
**Required:** The GUID of the application, can be found via API calls

**EITHER THE app_name OR THE app_guid PARAMETER NEED TO BE PROVIDED**

# Optional paramters
### `sandbox_name`
**Optional:** The name of the sandbox
### `sandbox_guid`
**Optional:** The GUID of the sandbox, can be found via API calls

# Description
The Veracode Flaw Importer will only import static analysis findings of the last scan with the provided information. Either from a policy scan or from a sandbox scan.

Please be aware that the scan first has to finish before the results can be imported

### In Pipeline usage
If you are using this flaw importer within your pipeline, make sure the previous task, most probably the Veracode action **uploadandscan**, is using the **scantimeout** option to wait for the scan to finish before you import the flaws.
As well keep in mind that a scan with flaws found and rated by policy will fail your step if **scantimeout** is set. In order to run the next step and import the findings please add **if: ${{ failure() }}** to your **Import Flaws** step

## Example usage

The following example will import flaws from an application profile called "Verademo" and a corresponding sandbox called "Feature ABC"

The Veracode credentials are read from github secrets. NEVER STORE YOUR SECRETS IN THE REPOSITORY.

```yaml
    # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
    # *** NOTE: This step is COMPULSORY, as the script requires the source file to determine the
    #           filepath prefix in order for the code could be successfully loaded for preview 
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Getflaws
      if: ${{ failure() }}
      uses: ./ 
      # Uses an action in the root directory. If you are using this action in your own workflow, 
      # make sure you replace this with action reference, for e.g. julz0815/veracode_flaw_importer@main
      env: 
        VERACODE_API_KEY_ID: '${{ secrets.VERACODE_API_ID }}'
        VERACODE_API_KEY_SECRET: '${{ secrets.VERACODE_API_KEY }}'
      id: get_flaws  
      with:
        app_name: 'Verademo'
        sandbox_name: 'Feature ABC'
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@master
      if: ${{ failure() }}
      with:
        name: flaws
        path: /home/runner/work/veracode_flaw_importer/veracode_flaw_importer/fullResults.json
    - uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v1
      if: ${{ failure() }}
      with:
        # Path to SARIF file relative to the root of the repository
        sarif_file: fullResults.json
```
Make sure you replace the repository name on the uplaod artifact step from 
```
path: /home/runner/work/veracode_flaw_importer/veracode_flaw_importer/fullResults.json
````
to
```
path: /home/runner/work/YOUR_REPO_NAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME/fullResults.json
```
